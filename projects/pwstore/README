Password Locker:

This is an application that encrypts your file with a password for safe and secure storage

Uses:

- it allows users to 'lock'/ secure their passwords

- it also helps users to generate complex passwords
  for their files to avoid hackers

* To run in windows, double click the file psw.jar

* To run in linux run ./pswd on the command line.
   
  This works in 3 ways:

- To open the graphical interface, type;
    ./pswd

- To show the saved files on the screen, type;
    ./pswd .

 This will propmt the user to enter the password they used to save the files.
 
- To search for a specific entity in the saved file, type;
    ./pswd . (search name)

 For example if the filename contains students names, search for a student by name,
 the output prints 5 lines from the requested output.
